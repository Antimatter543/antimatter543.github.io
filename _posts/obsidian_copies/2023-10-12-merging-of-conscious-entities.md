(the things below don't directly follow from our properties above… they're kinda just more properties no?)  
These guys aren't really main ideas like the above ones, they're just some fun guesses. So this is basically a fun extra before our conclusion :)

- There is no possible "merging of consciousness" and retaining both of them as distinct entities — that is: 2 conscious entities merging into one can be accomplished but it will produce an entity who will feel like has always been "one" thing. Somewhat akin to how you are one person, who may have dreamed many lives. But it is still one consciousness.
this has some usefulness for ideas I'll talk about in future blogs.

 I believe 'merging' of consciousness' to be similar. This has some consequences for transferring conscious entities. But also… duplication of conscience would be possible? This idea is a bit unnerving to me, but I don't see a reason why not if you could capture the entire state of a conscious entity at a given point in time. Sure, maybe you could have difficulties "interpreting" them (similar to how weights in a neural network, whilst known, are hard to figure out exactly what they do and their specific/generalised role into the entire system. And I also just realise this exact same thing occurs for the brain — we kinda know what sections like the occipital lobe do, but they don't do *just* that; whilst they are specialised, they are also multipurpose.)

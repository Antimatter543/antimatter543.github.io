Hey everyone, right now the site's in progress (13/1/23). I'm moving some posts over to this from my old website (https://github.com/Antimatter543/old-site). This isn't currently the highest on my priority list.
It should be finished by 20th February! If you've caught me at an intermediary stage... Hi!


I'm POTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTING. I do want to eventually put a nice neat timeline up somewhere, and also potentially have a section for my book that has a TBD complete date ðŸ˜­. Because what am I gonna do, make it over years, with nobody to read it and then publish? How many people are gonna read that? If I'm gonna make a book, I'm making it because I enjoy creating it, and because I want people to read it! I'd probably have a way for it to be free.

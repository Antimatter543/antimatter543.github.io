# Summary
[See the github repo by clicking here](https://github.com/Antimatter543/Flask-website-school)

I made a simple flask website for a school assignment in Year 12 that lets you read/write to a database. I had to learn everything myself (using some great readthedocs-- the website is basically a glorified tutorial) because our teacher(s) (we've had 4 different teachers in 1.5 years) haven't really taught us anything for the past 2 years. Fun!

I had to make a video for this, so I'm blaming the teacher's lack of teaching for my complete lack of enthusiasm in it. I suggest at least putting it on 1.25x speed.

Flask is pretty nifty!

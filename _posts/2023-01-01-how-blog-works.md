This is just going to describe how I plan to use this site, as well as some quirks and terminology that I like doing.


- blah blah
- lunasolan maybe
- blog about either career stuff, or just introspection and exploration thoughts

### Some Notation
I like em dashes -- seriously.
I like going on tangents. If I think a tangent offers enough intrigue, I might place it in a post like the next sentence. <a href='' class='tooltip'> An interesting aside. <span> You know, these tangents aren't usually trivial! Like, some of them are actually quite wordy and contain interesting ideas or aside (at least, that's what I say to myself), but I deem them too contextually jarring to keep in the post as pure linear text -- this is a choose your own adventure! </span> </a>
<!-- Should I change this to just be <tangent string="..."> blah here</tangent> ?? Does that even work? -->
<!-- <tangent content="You know, these tangents aren't usually trivial!

">An interesting aside.</tangent> Wrapping here doesn't work. -->


### Extras: Blogging process
I'm not sure how I plan to write my posts. I think, I start with the initial idea and I usually construct them into sentences, and paragraphs, ... Then I cut and finetune (and this takes the majority of the time). Sometimes, rarely, I will enter a writing frenzy flow state and put out a piece of work that I deem of sufficient quality, and I end up releasing it (of course, with some minor changes afterwards).

Admittedly, I might too a bit *too much* idea jumping, which can be somewhat jarring for readers. I think there is some charm to switching ideas, following tangents through and exploring them, but I do need to work on this.

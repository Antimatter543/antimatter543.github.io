My Jekyll site, woohoo! This is the 3rd website design I've had, but hopefully I'll like it enough for it to stay.

## Projects
Projects are stored in the _data/home.yml, and follow this format:
project_entries:
  - title: Project 1
    url: overview-post
    desc: This is an example project, configured in _data/home.yml

Later, I might have another frontmatter to link to a blog post if it exists, but for now I'll let it just go to github.

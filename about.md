ðŸš§ WIP!! ðŸš§

I'm a human, and I think universal function approximators are pretty cool!

Sometimes, I like having a gander at large problems, or just things to *think about*, playing with the ideas and see where they lead, what consequences they would have, even if the idea itself may sound out there or infeasible. It's just fun to do! I'd love to write about these in blogs as well, although I feel like they deserve a different section since they'd be pretty different to the vibe that my usual blogs -- i.e practical career progression, ... -- like *first hackathon*, *flask website*, ... have.

But guess what? It's [my website](https://github.com/Antimatter543/antimatter543.github.io) :D

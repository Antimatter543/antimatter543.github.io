ðŸš§ WIP!! ðŸš§

I'm a human, and I think universal function approximators are pretty cool! I'm a game theory enjoyer: computation is based.

Sometimes, I like having a gander at large problems, or just things to *think about*, playing with the ideas and see where they lead, what consequences they would have, even if the idea itself may sound out there or infeasible. It's just fun to do! I'd love to write about these in blogs as well, although I feel like they deserve a different section since they'd be pretty different to the vibe that my usual blogs -- i.e practical career progression, ... -- like *first hackathon*, *flask website*, ... have.


Sometimes, I like writing about problems that I'm just struggling with, or to have a conversation with myself. It's not really intended for professional sakes, but I post it because why not? Just a bit of tidying up and there we go! Life can be about more than just my pure profession.
It's a bit strange to do this, but I realised something very simple but also very important: it's [my website](https://github.com/Antimatter543/antimatter543.github.io). To live out my life without talking about the things I want to talk about sounds too sad, even if it might not necessarily boost my odds of being a favourable developer candidate. 

XKCD 137!


Side note: I highly recommend being exposed to at least some discrete maths in your lifetime -- sets, boolean logic, implies, basic proofs. It gives you an understanding of precision, and lets you understand how important definitions are. If you have different definitions, then, you can't undermine someone else's statements.
